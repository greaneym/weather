weather
========

This is a web2py app that uses NWS service to show weather in US after a user enters a location. The RSS feed is embedded in the app. This can be
modified to only show a particular location by removing the form and
adding the specific airport acronym in the weatherfeed controller.
Use of the app is limited by the National Weather Service. See their 
page for details. The BeautifulSoup lib was added to the default libs.
